          <h1>Chihiro's travel</h1>

          <p>
            Chihiro is a 10-year-old girl who believes that the entire universe should cater to her whims. When she finds out that she is moving, she is furious. On the trip, Chihiro realizes that her father got lost on the way to the new city, ending up in front of an apparently endless tunnel, guarded by a strange statue. Curious, Chihiro's parents decide to enter the tunnel and Chihiro goes with them. They arrive in a town with no inhabitants and Chihiro's parents decide to eat food from one of the houses while the girl walks around. She meets Haku, a boy who tells her to leave as quickly as possible and upon meeting her parents, Chihiro is surprised to see that they have turned into gigantic pigs. It is the beginning of Chihiro's journey through a ghost world, populated by fantastic beings, in which humans are not welcome.
